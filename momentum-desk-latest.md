## What's Going On

The market is holding an uptrend but losing some of its edge, with breadth reading 60% of the scanned universe above its 50-day moving average and 5 distribution days in the past month -- an elevated count worth watching. Zooming out, breadth has been improving over the last 60 sessions (+5.5 pt change in % above the 50-day MA) and deteriorating over the last two weeks (-3.8 pt), while SPY is roughly flat (+1.2% over 60 sessions, -0.9% over the last two weeks). Momentum under the surface is leaning firmly long -- 23 name(s) hit a fresh 52-week high today against 5 breaking down to a fresh 52-week low. Energy is leading, with 57% of its 21 scanned names carrying an RS score of 70+ and 10 clearing a screen outright today, with Health Care also showing real strength. It's being driven by names like HAL and BKR. With 78 name(s) clearing a screen across 10 sector(s), there's a workable watchlist below -- see Worth Watching for the shortlist tied to today's regime and themes.

## 1. Market Pulse

SPY close: 763.47 | 10-day MA: 769.82 | 20-day MA: 763.55

**Caution** — 10-day above 20-day but losing upward slope. Trade smaller, tighter.

- Breadth: 60% of the scanned universe above its 50-day MA, 74% above its 200-day MA.
- 52-week breakouts vs breakdowns today: 23 breakouts / 5 breakdowns (out of 519 names evaluated).
- Distribution days (SPY, trailing 25 sessions): 5. Elevated -- a headwind even if price is holding up.
- Follow-through day: none in the recent window.

## 6. Names to Avoid / Under Distribution

No prior leaders showing a clear technical breakdown flagged today.

## 7. Risk & Process Notes
- Universe scanned: 520 tickers.
- Minervini stop discipline: ~7-8% max below entry, sized to keep account risk small.
- Qullamaggie stop discipline: stop within ~1x ADR of entry; risk ~0.25-1% of account per trade.
- VCP/staging flags are rule-based approximations of a visual pattern — confirm on the linked TradingView chart.
- Leading Themes is ranked by breadth of RS strength, not raw average price change, so it isn't skewed by one outlier name in an otherwise quiet sector.
- Breadth, distribution-day, and follow-through-day stats are simplified approximations of IBD's own methodology, computed from the same price history already pulled for this run — directional signal, not an exact replica.
- If the Market Pulse section above reads "Defensive," treat every long breakout here as lower-probability.
