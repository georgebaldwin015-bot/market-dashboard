## What's Going On

The market is in a confirmed uptrend, with breadth reading 30% of the scanned universe above its 50-day moving average and 7 distribution days in the past month -- an elevated count worth watching. Zooming out, breadth has been deteriorating over the last 60 sessions (-33.4 pt change in % above the 50-day MA) and roughly flat over the last two weeks (+0.0 pt), while SPY is climbing (+3.9% over 60 sessions, +1.5% over the last two weeks). That's a narrow-leadership divergence worth flagging -- SPY's recent climb isn't being confirmed by broader participation. Momentum under the surface is leaning long -- 19 name(s) hit a fresh 52-week high today against 11 breaking down to a fresh 52-week low. Information Technology is leading, with 60% of its 90 scanned names carrying an RS score of 70+ and 32 clearing a screen outright today, with Energy also showing real strength. It's being driven by names like DELL, MRVL and AMD. With 69 name(s) clearing a screen across 10 sector(s), there's a workable watchlist below -- see Worth Watching for the shortlist tied to today's regime and themes.

## 1. Market Pulse

Market cycle: **Bull** -- equal-weight universe index +4.4% vs its 200-day MA, 50-day MA +6.2% vs the 200-day. Trade normally.

SPY close: 779.09 | 10-day MA: 768.63 | 20-day MA: 765.06

**Constructive** — 10-day MA above the 20-day and rising.

- Breadth: 30% of the scanned universe above its 50-day MA, 50% above its 200-day MA.
- 52-week breakouts vs breakdowns today: 19 breakouts / 11 breakdowns (out of 518 names evaluated).
- Distribution days (SPY, trailing 25 sessions): 7. Elevated -- a headwind even if price is holding up.
- Follow-through day: none in the recent window.

## 4. Worth Watching

Market regime reads **constructive**, and **Information Technology** is leading with 60% of its names carrying RS 70+ and 32 clearing a screen outright today. On that basis, these 8 name(s) are worth watching:

## 5. Other Setups (context)

No Episodic Pivots or notably extended/parabolic names flagged today.

## 6. Names to Avoid / Under Distribution

No prior leaders showing a clear technical breakdown flagged today.

## 7. Risk & Process Notes
- Universe scanned: 520 tickers.
- Minervini stop discipline: ~7-8% max below entry, sized to keep account risk small.
- Qullamaggie stop discipline: stop within ~1x ADR of entry; risk ~0.25-1% of account per trade.
- VCP/staging flags are rule-based approximations of a visual pattern — confirm on the linked TradingView chart.
- Leading Themes is ranked by breadth of RS strength, not raw average price change, so it isn't skewed by one outlier name in an otherwise quiet sector.
- Breadth, distribution-day, and follow-through-day stats are simplified approximations of IBD's own methodology, computed from the same price history already pulled for this run — directional signal, not an exact replica.
- A "Defensive" Market Pulse read doesn't rule a setup out: in the backtest, skipping those entries cut the return.
