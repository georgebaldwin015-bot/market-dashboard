## What's Going On

The market is in a defensive posture, with breadth reading 58% of the scanned universe above its 50-day moving average and 6 distribution days in the past month -- an elevated count worth watching. Zooming out, breadth has been deteriorating over the last 60 sessions (-9.6 pt change in % above the 50-day MA) and improving over the last two weeks (+13.6 pt), while SPY is roughly flat (+0.6% over 60 sessions, +0.1% over the last two weeks). Momentum under the surface is leaning long -- 23 name(s) hit a fresh 52-week high today against 14 breaking down to a fresh 52-week low. Energy is leading, with 71% of its 21 scanned names carrying an RS score of 70+ and 14 clearing a screen outright today, with Health Care also showing real strength. It's being driven by names like MPC, PSX and APA. With 93 name(s) clearing a screen across 11 sector(s), there's a workable watchlist below -- see Worth Watching for the shortlist tied to today's regime and themes.

## 1. Market Pulse

Market cycle: **Bull** -- equal-weight universe index +6.1% vs its 200-day MA, 50-day MA +4.8% vs the 200-day. Trade normally.

SPY close: 772.31 | 10-day MA: 767.49 | 20-day MA: 770.90

**Defensive** — 10-day MA below the 20-day. Setups that still pass the rules here averaged a little less (+0.5R vs +0.7R a trade) but skipping them cut the backtest's return: trade the plan.

- Breadth: 58% of the scanned universe above its 50-day MA, 61% above its 200-day MA.
- 52-week breakouts vs breakdowns today: 23 breakouts / 14 breakdowns (out of 519 names evaluated).
- Distribution days (SPY, trailing 25 sessions): 6. Elevated -- a headwind even if price is holding up.
- Follow-through day: none in the recent window.

**VCP heuristic:** volatility (ATR%) and volume have been contracting across the last three 10-day blocks — the pattern Minervini describes as a base tightening ahead of a breakout. Confirm this shape visually on the chart; the heuristic can't see the actual price structure, only the numbers.

## 5. Other Setups (context)

No Episodic Pivots or notably extended/parabolic names flagged today.

## 6. Names to Avoid / Under Distribution

No prior leaders showing a clear technical breakdown flagged today.

## 7. Risk & Process Notes
- Universe scanned: 520 tickers.
- Minervini stop discipline: ~7-8% max below entry, sized to keep account risk small.
- Qullamaggie stop discipline: stop within ~1x ADR of entry; risk ~0.25-1% of account per trade.
- VCP/staging flags are rule-based approximations of a visual pattern — confirm on the linked TradingView chart.
- Leading Themes is ranked by breadth of RS strength, not raw average price change, so it isn't skewed by one outlier name in an otherwise quiet sector.
- Breadth, distribution-day, and follow-through-day stats are simplified approximations of IBD's own methodology, computed from the same price history already pulled for this run — directional signal, not an exact replica.
- A "Defensive" Market Pulse read doesn't rule a setup out: in the backtest, skipping those entries cut the return.
