## What's Going On

The market is holding an uptrend but losing some of its edge, with breadth reading 53% of the scanned universe above its 50-day moving average and 6 distribution days in the past month -- an elevated count worth watching. Zooming out, breadth has been deteriorating over the last 60 sessions (-19.2 pt change in % above the 50-day MA) and improving over the last two weeks (+23.2 pt), while SPY is climbing (+4.1% over 60 sessions, -1.1% over the last two weeks). Breadth actually improving while SPY chops or pulls back is a healthier under-the-surface signal than the index alone suggests. Momentum under the surface is leaning firmly long -- 35 name(s) hit a fresh 52-week high today against 7 breaking down to a fresh 52-week low. Energy is leading, with 71% of its 21 scanned names carrying an RS score of 70+ and 14 clearing a screen outright today, with Health Care also showing real strength. It's being driven by names like MPC, VLO and APA. With 87 name(s) clearing a screen across 10 sector(s), there's a workable watchlist below -- see Worth Watching for the shortlist tied to today's regime and themes.

## 1. Market Pulse

Market cycle: **Bull** -- equal-weight universe index +5.6% vs its 200-day MA, 50-day MA +5.3% vs the 200-day. Trade normally.

SPY close: 769.05 | 10-day MA: 772.60 | 20-day MA: 770.62

**Caution** — 10-day above 20-day but losing upward slope. Setups entered on caution days did no worse in the backtest: trade the plan.

- Breadth: 53% of the scanned universe above its 50-day MA, 56% above its 200-day MA.
- 52-week breakouts vs breakdowns today: 35 breakouts / 7 breakdowns (out of 519 names evaluated).
- Distribution days (SPY, trailing 25 sessions): 6. Elevated -- a headwind even if price is holding up.
- Follow-through day: none in the recent window.

## 5. Other Setups (context)

No Episodic Pivots or notably extended/parabolic names flagged today.

## 6. Names to Avoid / Under Distribution

No prior leaders showing a clear technical breakdown flagged today.

## 7. Risk & Process Notes
- Universe scanned: 520 tickers.
- Minervini stop discipline: ~7-8% max below entry, sized to keep account risk small.
- Qullamaggie stop discipline: stop within ~1x ADR of entry; risk ~0.25-1% of account per trade.
- VCP/staging flags are rule-based approximations of a visual pattern — confirm on the linked TradingView chart.
- Leading Themes is ranked by breadth of RS strength, not raw average price change, so it isn't skewed by one outlier name in an otherwise quiet sector.
- Breadth, distribution-day, and follow-through-day stats are simplified approximations of IBD's own methodology, computed from the same price history already pulled for this run — directional signal, not an exact replica.
- A "Defensive" Market Pulse read doesn't rule a setup out: in the backtest, skipping those entries cut the return.
