## 1. Market Pulse

SPY close: 729.46 | 10-day MA: 741.83 | 20-day MA: 745.79

**Defensive** — 10-day MA below the 20-day. Per Qullamaggie's market filter, long breakouts/EPs are lower-probability here; Minervini would favor raising cash. Parabolic-short context becomes more relevant, not breakout longs.

- Breadth: 66% of the scanned universe above its 50-day MA, 69% above its 200-day MA.
- 52-week breakouts vs breakdowns today: 22 breakouts / 6 breakdowns (out of 520 names evaluated).
- Distribution days (SPY, trailing 25 sessions): 7. Elevated -- a headwind even if price is holding up.
- Follow-through day: none in the recent window.

**VCP heuristic:** volatility (ATR%) and volume have been contracting across the last three 10-day blocks — the pattern Minervini describes as a base tightening ahead of a breakout. Confirm this shape visually on the chart; the heuristic can't see the actual price structure, only the numbers.

## 7. Risk & Process Notes
- Universe scanned: 521 tickers.
- Minervini stop discipline: ~7-8% max below entry, sized to keep account risk small.
- Qullamaggie stop discipline: stop within ~1x ADR of entry; risk ~0.25-1% of account per trade.
- VCP/staging flags are rule-based approximations of a visual pattern — confirm on the linked TradingView chart.
- Leading Themes is ranked by breadth of RS strength, not raw average price change, so it isn't skewed by one outlier name in an otherwise quiet sector.
- Breadth, distribution-day, and follow-through-day stats are simplified approximations of IBD's own methodology, computed from the same price history already pulled for this run — directional signal, not an exact replica.
- If the Market Pulse section above reads "Defensive," treat every long breakout here as lower-probability.
